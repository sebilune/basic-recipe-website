                <ol>
                    <li>Prepare the burger patties by shaping ground beef into evenly sized patties, about 1/4 to 1/2 inch thick. Season both sides of the patties with salt and pepper.</li>
                    <li>Heat a grill, stovetop skillet, or griddle over medium-high heat. Brush the cooking surface with oil to prevent sticking.</li>
                    <li>Place the burger patties onto the hot cooking surface and cook for about 3-4 minutes per side, or until they reach your desired level of doneness (e.g., medium-rare, medium, well-done).</li>
                    <li>If using cheese, add a slice of cheese on top of each patty during the last minute of cooking and allow it to melt.</li>
                    <li>Meanwhile, toast the burger buns on the grill or in a toaster until lightly golden.</li>
                    <li>Assemble the burger by placing a cooked patty on the bottom half of a bun. Add lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, and condiments of your choice on top of the patty.</li>
                    <li>Place the top half of the bun over the toppings to complete the burger.</li>
                    <li>Serve hot and enjoy your delicious homemade beef burger!</li>
